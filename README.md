# WebScrapper

Project overview : WEB SCRAPING USING PYTHON

Objectives
Web Scraping: Obtain inspirational quotes along with their authors and tags from the specified website using web scraping techniques.
Data Extraction: Extract relevant information from the HTML content of the webpage, including the text of the quotes, the authors, and associated tags.
Data Storage: Save the extracted quotes into a structured format, specifically a CSV file, for easy storage and future analysis.
Automation: Automate the process of fetching, parsing, and storing quotes to provide a streamlined and efficient solution for users.

Key Components
Requests Library: To make HTTP requests to the specified URL.
Usage: requests.get(url)

BeautifulSoup Library: To parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract relevant information.
Usage: BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

Data Extraction:
Quotes List: A list to store dictionaries representing each quote.
Quote Information Extraction: Utilize BeautifulSoup to find and extract text, author, and tags for each quote.

CSV File Handling:
Filename: Use the filename 'inspirational_quotes.csv' for storing the extracted data.
CSV Writing: Utilize the csv.DictWriter to write the extracted quotes to the CSV file.

Error Handling:
HTTP Status Code Check: Verify if the HTTP request was successful (status code 200).
Print Statements: Display success or failure messages based on the status of the HTTP request.

Code Structure:
Main Script Flow: Follow a sequential process of making the request, parsing the HTML, extracting information, and saving it to a CSV file.
Looping Through Quotes: Utilize a loop to iterate through each quote on the webpage and extract relevant details.

Configurability:
Hardcoded URL: Allow users to modify the URL easily for scraping different websites by making it a variable.

Enhancements:
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling mechanisms for connection issues, timeouts, and potential changes in the website structure.
Scalability: Design the script to handle variations in the HTML structure, making it more adaptable to changes on the target website.
User Feedback Improvement: Provide detailed feedback to users, such as the number of quotes scraped or potential error details.

Data Structures
List: To store the information of each quote in a structured manner.
Dictionary: To represent the structure of each quote with key-value pairs for text, author, and tags.
Strings: To store the URL, filename, and various text elements extracted from the HTML.
CSV File: To persistently store the scraped data.
